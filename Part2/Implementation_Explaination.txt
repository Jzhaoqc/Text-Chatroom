Private Messaging Implementation:
    1. Added commands "/p-msg" to the client at START, LOGIN, and JOINED stages, respectively.
        a. First argument is the target of the private message.
        b. Second argument is the message that will be sent.
    2. Added message type TYPE_PRIV_MESSAGE to represent a private message.
    3. Added global list "users" to track all online users.
        a. When a user logs in, it will be added into the list
        b. When a user logs out or disconnects, it will be changed to NULL.
    4. Added chatroom function "send_priv_message" to loop through all the users and send to the matched one.
    5. When server detects the packet is a private message, it calls the "send_priv_message" function.

Multiple Session Implementation:
    1. Added functionality to join multiple session when a user is logged in and already joined a session.
        a. Using same command /joinsession <session id> to join any amount session while the user is logged in
    2. Added feature that automatically leaves all sessions a user is currently in when recieving /leavesession command.
        a. Due to the function requirement that leavesession packet does not specify which session to leave and 
           it is required to keep all functionalities from the first part, the group implemented leave session to
           leave all sessions.
    3. Message viewable in multiple sessions when the sender is joined in such sessions.
        a. By adding message header that specifies which chatroom and which sender a message is from,
           when the message is broadcasted the receivers would be able to tell which room this message came from.
